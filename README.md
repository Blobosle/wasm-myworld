# Automated WASM Minecraft Snapshot Journal

Website made using Web Assembly with emscripten C++, React, and Shell scripting, that automatically records screenshots taken inside of a Minecraft world.

## Purpose of the site

The Minecraft world being recorded is a "forever world" that is going to be played indefinitely, and the journaling work done is to keep a secure progression for looking back at in the future.
